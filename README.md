### üìã Core Functionality
- **Dynamic Photo Loading:** Fetch photos from Picsum Photos API with pagination
- **Infinite Scroll:** Load more photos automatically as user scrolls
- **Search Functionality:** Real-time search with debouncing (500ms delay)
- **Photo Details Modal:** View full-size images with metadata and navigation
- **Favorites System:** Like/unlike photos with persistent storage
- **Filter by Favorites:** Toggle between all photos and favorites only
- **Responsive Grid Layout:** Adaptive CSS Grid (1-4 columns based on screen size)

### üí° User Experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts

### Angular 17+ Features
- **Standalone Components:** No NgModules, simplified architecture
- **Signals API:** Reactive state management without RxJS boilerplate
  - `signal()` - Writable reactive state
  - `computed()` - Derived reactive values
  - `effect()` - Side effects on signal changes
- **New Control Flow:** `@if`, `@for`, `@else` syntax
- **Signal Inputs:** `input.required<T>()` for component inputs
- **Signal Outputs:** `output<T>()` for event emission

### Core Angular Concepts Covered
1. **Component Architecture**
   - Smart vs Presentational components
   - Component communication (inputs/outputs)
   - Lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit, OnDestroy)
   - ViewChild for DOM access

2. **Services & Dependency Injection**
   - `inject()` function for field-level DI
   - Singleton services with `providedIn: 'root'`
   - Service composition and delegation pattern
   - HTTP client integration

3. **Reactive Programming**
   - RxJS Observables, Operators, and Subjects
   - Operators: `map`, `tap`, `catchError`, `debounceTime`, `distinctUntilChanged`
   - Signal-based reactivity vs Observable patterns
   - Async pipe for template subscriptions

4. **State Management**
   - Centralized state with PhotoService
   - Immutable state updates with signals
   - Computed values for derived state
   - LocalStorage persistence strategy

5. **Forms & User Input**
   - Template-driven search with reactive updates
   - Input debouncing for performance
   - Form state management with signals

6. **HTTP & API Integration**
   - HttpClient for REST API calls
   - Error handling with catchError
   - Retry logic and timeout strategies
   - Response transformation and mapping

7. **Styling & Responsive Design**
   - SCSS/SASS with component-scoped styles
   - CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
   - Media queries for responsive breakpoints
   - CSS transitions and animations
